===================

This repository contains tools created to help myself to grade students faster.


Why is node_modules/ included?
------------------------------

- It is relatively small.
- Custom "improvements" where made to the gulp-css-validator index.js file.

---


Using getmail.py
----------------

- **Current version does not support none ASCII characters in attatchment filenames!**
- Forward your emails to a gmail account.
- Put target emails into the starred folder.
- Make sure you have IMAP enabled in your gmail settings.
- Also make sure you change the access for settings for less secure apps to enabled:
    - https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
- Run getmail.py.




_Tools in this repo only tested on Ubuntu 14.04._
